   - Should take < 5 minutes

2. **Linting**

   ```bash
   flake8 mylogger/ tests/
   ```

   - Catches potential issues
   - Should take < 5 minutes

3. **Type Checking** (optional but recommended)
   ```bash
   mypy mylogger/
   ```
   - Verifies type hints
   - May need minor fixes

### Medium Priority (Nice to Have)

4. **Clean up TODO comments**

   - 3 TODOs in placeholder/test files
   - Can be addressed or documented
   - Not critical for release

5. **Memory leak testing**

   - Run long-running scenarios
   - Monitor resource usage
   - Verify handler cleanup

6. **Cross-platform testing**
   - Test on Linux (recommended)
   - Test on macOS (recommended)
   - Currently tested on Windows only
